## Ficl ##

A fork (of https://github.com/pahihu/ficl) which is a fork of the original ficl.

This varaint has a number of changes that will save me some time.

Most of all it builds and works on 64 bit systems.

------
### Build Instructions

Run:

```bash
./buildDebug.sh
```

or
```bash
./buildRelease.sh
```

This will result in a Debug or Release folder in which a build has taken place.
